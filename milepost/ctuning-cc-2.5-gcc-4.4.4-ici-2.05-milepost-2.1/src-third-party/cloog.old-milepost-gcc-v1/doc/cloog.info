1 Introduction
**************

CLooG is a free software and library generating loops for scanning
Z-polyhedra.  That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that
reaches each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
CLooG has been originally written to solve the code generation problem
for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model. Nevertheless it
is used now in various area, e.g., to build control automata for
high-level synthesis or to find the best polynomial approximation of a
function. CLooG may help in any situation where scanning polyhedra
matters. It uses the best state-of-the-art code generation algorithm
known as the Quillere' et al. algorithm (*note Qui00::) with our own
improvements and extensions (*note Bas04::).  The user has full control
on generated code quality.  On one hand, generated code size has to be
tuned for sake of readability or instruction cache use. On the other
hand, we must ensure that a bad control management does not hamper
performance of the generated code, for instance by producing redundant
guards or complex loop bounds.  CLooG is specially designed to avoid
control overhead and to produce a very efficient code.

   CLooG stands for _Chunky Loop Generator_: it is a part of the Chunky
project, a research tool for data locality improvement (*note Bas03a::).
It is designed also to be the back-end of automatic parallelizers like
LooPo (*note Gri04::).  Thus it is very compilable code oriented and
provides powerful program transformation facilities. Mainly, it allows
the user to specify very general schedules where, e.g., unimodularity
or invertibility of the transformation doesn't matter.

   The current version is still under evaluation, and there is no
guarantee that the upward compatibility will be respected (but the
previous API has been stable for two years, we hope this one will be as
successful -and we believe it-).  A lot of reports are necessary to
freeze the library API and the input file shape. Most API changes from
0.12.x to 0.14.x have been requested by the users themselves.  Thus you
are very welcome and encouraged to post reports on bugs, wishes,
critics, comments, suggestions or successful experiences in the forum
of `http://www.CLooG.org' or to send them to cedric.bastoul@inria.fr

1.1 Basically, what's the point ?
=================================

If you want to use CLooG, this is because you want to scan or to find
something inside the integral points of a set of polyhedra. There are
many reasons for that. Maybe you need the generated code itself because
it actually implements a very smart program transformation you found.
Maybe you want to use the generated code because you know that the
solution of your problem belongs to the integral points of those damned
polyhedra and you don't know which one. Maybe you just want to know if
a polyhedron has integral points depending on some parameters, which is
the lexicographic minimum, maximum, the third on the basis of the left
etc. Probably you have your own reasons to use CLooG.

   Let us illustrate a basic use of CLooG. Suppose we have a set of
affine constraints that describes a part of a whatever-dimensional
space, called a *domain*, and we want to scan it. Let us consider for
instance the following set of constraints where `i' and `j' are the
unknown (the two dimensions of the space) and `m' and `n' are the
parameters (some symbolic constants):
     2<=i<=n
     2<=j<=m
     j<=n+2-i
Let us also consider that we have a partial knowledge of the
parameter values, called the *context*, expressed as affine constraints
as well, for instance:
     m>=2
     n>=2
Note that using parameters is optional, if you are not comfortable
with parameter manipulation, just replace them with any scalar value
that fits `m>=2' and `n>=2'.  A graphical representation of this part
of the 2-dimensional space, where the integral points are represented
using heavy dots would be for instance:

 j^ i>=2
  | | j<=n+2-i
  | |\     | i<=n
  | | \    |
m-+-****---+-j<=m
  | *****  |
  | ****** |
  | *******|
2-+-********-j>=2
  | |      |\
0-+-+------+--->i
  | |      |
  0 2      n

   The affine constraints of both the domain and the context are what
we will provide to CLooG as input (in a particular shape that will be
described later).  The output of CLooG is a pseudo-code to scan the
integral points of the input domain according to the context:
     for (i=2;i<=n;i++) {
       for (j=2;j<=min(m,-i+n+2);j++) {
         S1(i,j) ;
       }
     }
If you felt such a basic example is yet interesting, there is a
good chance that CLooG is appropriate for you. CLooG can do much more:
scanning several polyhedra or unions of polyhedra at the same time,
applying general affine transformations to the polyhedra, generate
compilable code etc. Welcome to the CLooG's user's guide !

1.2 Defining a Scanning Order: Scattering Functions
===================================================

In CLooG, domains only define the set of integral points to scan and
their coordinates. In particular, CLooG is free to choose the scanning
order for generating the most efficient code. This means, for
optimizing/parallelizing compiler people, that CLooG doesn't make any
speculation on dependences on and between statements (by the way, it's
not its job !).  For instance, if an user give to CLooG only two
domains `S1:1<=i<=n', `S2:1<=i<=n' and the context `n>=1', the
following pseudo-codes are considered to be equivalent:

     /* A convenient target pseudo-code. */
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
      S1(i) ;
     }
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
      S2(i) ;
     }

     /* Another convenient target pseudo-code. */
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
      S1(i) ;
      S2(i) ;
     }

   The default behaviour of CLooG is to generate the second one, since
it is optimized in control.  It is right if there are no data
dependences between `S1' and `S2', but wrong otherwise.

   Thus it is often useful to force scanning to respect a given order.
This can be done in CLooG by using *scattering functions*. Scattering
is a shortcut for scheduling, allocation, chunking functions and the
like we can find in the restructuring compilation litterature. There
are a lot of reasons to scatter the integral points of the domains
(i.e. the statement instances of a program, for compilation people),
parallelization or optimization are good examples. For instance, if the
user wants for any reason to set some precedence constraints between
the statements of our example above in order to force the generation of
the first code, he can do it easily by setting (for example) the
following scheduling functions:

     T_S1(i) = (1)
     T_S2(j) = (2)

   This scattering means that each integral point of the domain `S1' is
scanned at logical date `1' while each integral point of the domain
`S2' is scanned at logical date `2'. As a result, the whole domain `S1'
is scanned before domain `S2' and the first code in our example is
generated.

   The user can set every kind of affine scanning order thanks to the
scattering functions. Each domain has its own scattering function and
each scattering function may be multi-dimensional. A multi-dimentional
logical date may be seen as classical date
(year,month,day,hour,minute,etc.) where the first dimensions are the
most significant. Each scattering dimension may depend linearly on the
original dimensions (e.g., `i'), the parameters (e.g., `n') ans scalars
(e.g., `2').

   A very useful example of multi-dimensional scattering functions is,
for compilation people, the scheduling of the original program.  The
basic data to use for code generation are statement iteration domains.
As we saw, these data are not sufficient to rebuild the original
program (what is the ordering between instances of different statements
?).  The missing data can be put in the scattering functions as the
original scheduling. The method to compute it is quite simple (*note
Fea92::). The idea is to build an abstract syntax tree of the program
and to read the scheduling for each statement. For instance, let us
consider the following implementation of a Cholesky factorization:

     /* A Cholesky factorization kernel. */
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
       for (j=1;j<=i-1;j++) {
         a[i][i] -= a[i][j] ;           /* S1 */
       }
       a[i][i] = sqrt(a[i][i]) ;        /* S2 */
       for (j=i+1;j<=N;j++) {
         for (k=1;k<=i-1;k++) {
           a[j][i] -= a[j][k]*a[i][k] ; /* S3 */
         }
         a[j][i] /= a[i][i] ;           /* S4 */
         }
       }
     }

   The corresponding abstract syntax tree is given in the following
figure.  It directly gives the scattering functions (schedules) for all
the statements of the program.

          |
          |0
          |
          V
          S3

     T_S1(i,j)^T   = (0,i,0,j,0)^T
     T_S2(i)       = (0,i,1)^T
     T_S3(i,j,k)^T = (0,i,2,j,0,k,0)^T
     T_S4(i,j)^T   = (0,i,2,j,1)^T

   These schedules depend on the iterators and give for each instance
of each statement a unique execution date. Using such scattering
functions allow CLooG to re-generate the input code.

2.1 A First Example
===================

CLooG takes as input a file that must be written accordingly to a
grammar described in depth in a further section (*note Writing The
Input File::).  Moreover it supports many options to tune the target
code presentation or quality as discussed in a dedicated section (*note
Calling CLooG::).  However, a basic use of CLooG is not very complex
and we present in this section how to generate the code corresponding
to a basic example discussed earlier (*note Basics::).

   The problem is to find the code that scans a 2-dimensional polyhedron
where `i' and `j' are the unknown (the two dimensions of the space) and
`m' and `n' are the parameters (the symbolic constants), defined by the
following set of constraints:
     2<=i<=n
     2<=j<=m
     j<=n+2-i
We also consider a partial knowledge of the parameter values,
expressed thanks to the following affine constraints:
     m>=2
     n>=2

   An input file that corresponds to this problem, and asks for a
generated code in C, may be the following. Note that we do not describe
here precisely the structure and the components of this file (*note
Writing The Input File::  for such information, if you feel it
necessary):

     # ---------------------- CONTEXT ----------------------
     c # language is C

     # Context (constraints on two parameters)
     2 4                   # 2 lines and 4 columns
     # eq/in m  n  1         eq/in: 1 for inequality >=0, 0 for equality =0
         1   1  0 -2       # 1*m + 0*n -2*1 >= 0, i.e. m>=2
         1   0  1 -2       # 0*m + 1*n -2*1 >= 0, i.e. n>=2

     1 # We want to set manually the parameter names
     m n                   # parameter names

     # --------------------- STATEMENTS --------------------
     1 # Number of statements

     1 # First statement: one domain
     # First domain
     5 6                   # 5 lines and 6 columns
     # eq/in i  j  m  n  1
         1   1  0  0  0 -2 # i >= 2
         1  -1  0  0  1  0 # i <= n
         1   0  1  0  0 -2 # j >= 2
         1   0 -1  1  0  0 # j <= m
         1  -1 -1  0  1  2 # n+2-i>=j
     0  0  0               # for future options

     1 # We want to set manually the iterator names
     i j                   # iterator names

     # --------------------- SCATTERING --------------------
     0 # No scattering functions

   This file may be called `basic.cloog' (this example is provided in
the CLooG distribution as `test/manual_basic.cloog') and we can ask
CLooG to process it and to generate the code by a simple calling to
CLooG with this file as input: `cloog basic.cloog'. By default, CLooG
will print the generated code in the standard output:

     /* Generated by CLooG v0.15-UNKNOWN in 0.00s. */
     for (i=2;i<=n;i++) {
       for (j=2;j<=min(m,-i+n+2);j++) {
         S1(i,j) ;
       }
     }

2.2 Writing The Input File
==========================

The input text file contains a problem description, i.e. the context,
the domains and the scattering functions.  Because CLooG is very
'compilable code generation oriented', we can associate some additional
informations to each domain. We call this association a _statement_.
The set of all informations is called a _program_. The input file
respects the grammar below (terminals are preceeded by "_"):

     File             ::= Program
     Program          ::= Context Statements Scattering
     Context          ::= Language      Domain         Naming
     Statements       ::= Nb_statements Statement_list Naming
     Scattering       ::= Nb_functions  Domain_list    Naming
     Naming           ::= Option Name_list
     Name_list        ::= _String   Name_list      | (void)
     Statement_list   ::= Statement Statement_list | (void)
     Domain_list      ::= _Domain   Domain_list    | (void)
     Statement        ::= Iteration_domain 0 0 0
     Iteration_domain ::= Domain_union
     Domain_union     ::= Nb_domains Domain_list
     Option           ::= 0 | 1
     Language         ::= c | f
     Nb_statements    ::= _Integer
     Nb_domains       ::= _Integer
     Nb_functions     ::= _Integer

   * `Context' represents the informations that are        shared by
     all the statements. It consists on        the language used (which
     can be `c' for C or `f' for FORTRAN 90)        and the global
     constraints on parameters.         These constraints are essential
           since they give to CLooG the number of parameters. If there
     is no        parameter or no constraints on parameters, just give
     a constraint        always satisfied like 1 \geq 0. `Naming' sets
     the parameter        names.         If the naming option `Option'
     is 1, parameter names will be read        on the next line. There
     must be exactly as many names as parameters.         If the naming
     option `Option' is 0, parameter names are        automatically
     generated. The name of the first parameter will        be `M', and
     the name of the (n+1)^th parameter directly        follows the
     name of the n^th parameter in ASCII code.         It is the user
     responsibility to ensure that parameter names,        iterators
     and scattering dimension names are different.

   * `Statements' represents the informations on the statements.
     `Nb_statements' is the number of statements in the program,
     i.e. the number of `Statement' items in the `Statement_list'.
        `Statement' represents the informations on a given statement.
           To each statement is associated a domain        (the
     statement iteration domain: `Iteration_domain') and three
     zeroes that represents future options.         `Naming' sets the
     iterator names. If the naming option        `Option' is 1, the
     iterator names        will be read on the next line. There must be
     exactly as many names as        nesting level in the deepest
     iteration domain. If the naming option        `Option' is 0,
     iterator names are automatically generated.         The iterator
     name of the outermost loop will be `i', and the        iterator
     name of the loop at level n+1 directly follows the        iterator
     name of the loop at level n in ASCII code.

   * `Scattering' represents the informations on scattering functions.
           `Nb_functions' is the number of functions (it must be
     equal to the number of statements or 0 if there is no scattering
          function). The function themselves are represented through
         `Domain_list'.         `Naming' sets the scattering dimension
     names. If the naming option        `Option' is 1, the scattering
     dimension names will be read on the        next line.
     There must be exactly as many names as scattering dimensions. If
     the        naming option `Option' is 0, scattering dimension names
     are automatically        generated. The name of the n^th
     scattering dimention        will be `cn'.

2.2.1 Domain Representation
---------------------------

As shown by the grammar, the input file describes the various
informations thanks to characters, integers and domains. Each domain is
defined by a set of constraints in the PolyLib format (*note Wil93::).
They have the following syntax:
  1. some optional comment lines beginning with `#',

  2. the row and column numbers, possibly followed by comments,

  3. the constraint rows, each row corresponds to a constraint the
     domain have to satisfy. Each row must be on a single line and is
     possibly       followed by comments. The constraint is an equality
     p(x) = 0 if the       first element is 0, an inequality  p(x) \geq
     0 if the first element       is 1. The next elements are the
     unknown coefficients, followed by       the parameter
     coefficients. The last element is the constant factor.
        For instance, assuming that `i', `j' and `k' are iterators and
`m' and `n' are parameters, the domain defined by the following
constraints :

        -i + m >= 0
        -j + n >= 0
     i + j - k >= 0

can be written in the input file as follows :

     # This is the domain
     3 7                      # 3 lines and 7 columns
     # eq/in i  j  k  m  n  1
         1  -1  0  0  1  0  0 #    -i + m >= 0
         1   0 -1  0  0  1  0 #    -j + n >= 0
         1   1  1 -1  0  0  0 # i + j - k >= 0

   Each iteration domain `Iteration_domain' of a given statement is a
union of polyhedra `Domain_union'. A union is defined by its number of
elements `Nb_domains' and the elements themselves `Domain_list'.  For
instance, let us consider the following pseudo-code:

     for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
       if ((i >= m) || (i <= 2*m))
         S1 ;
       for (j=i+1;j<=m;j++)
         S2 ;
     }

The iteration domain of `S1' can be divided into two polyhedra and
written in the input file as follows:

     2 # Number of polyhedra in the union
     # First domain
     3 5                # 3 lines and 5 columns
     # eq/in i  m  n  1
         1   1  0  0 -1 #  i >= 1
         1  -1  0  1  0 #  i <= n
         1   1 -1  0  0 #  i >= m

2.2.2 Scattering Function Representation
----------------------------------------

Scattering functions are depicted in the input file thanks a
representation very close to the domain one.  An integer gives the
number of functions `Nb_functions' and each function is represented by
a domain. Each line of the domain corresponds to an equality defining a
dimension of the function. Note that at present (CLooG 0.15-UNKNOWN)
*all functions must have the same scattering dimension number*. If a
user wants to set scattering functions with different dimensionality,
he has to complete the smaller one with zeroes to reach the maximum
dimensionality.  For instance, let us consider the following code and
scheduling functions:

     for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
       if ((i >= m) || (i <= 2*m))
         S1 ;
       for (j=i+1;j<=m;j++)
         S2 ;
     }

     T_S1(i)     = (i,0)^T
     T_S2(i,j)^T = (n,i+j)^T

This scheduling can be written in the input file as follows:

     2 # Number of scattering functions
     # First function
     2 7                          # 2 lines and 7 columns
     # eq/in c1 c2  i  m  n  1
         0    1  0 -1  0  0  0    #  c1 = i
         0    0  1  0  0  0  0    #  c2 = 0
     # Second function
     2 8                          # 2 lines and 8 columns
     # eq/in c1 c2  i  j  m  n  1
         0    1  0  0  0  0 -1  0 #  c1 = n
         0    0  1 -1 -1  0  0  0 #  c2 = i+j
The complete input file for the user who wants to generate the
code for this example with the preceding scheduling would be (this file
is provided in the CLooG distribution as `test/manual_scattering.cloog':

2.3 Calling CLooG
=================

CLooG is called by the following command:
            cloog [ options | file ]
   The default behavior of CLooG is to read the input informations from
a file and to print the generated code or pseudo-code on the standard
output.  CLooG's behavior and the output code shape is under the user
control thanks to many options which are detailed a further section
(*note CLooG Options::).  `file' is the input file. `stdin' is a
special value: when used, input is standard input. For instance, we can
call CLooG to treat the input file `basic.cloog' with default options
by typing: `cloog basic.cloog' or `more basic.cloog | cloog stdin'.

File: cloog.info,  Node: Last Depth to Optimize Control,  Next: First Depth to Optimize Control,  Up: CLooG Options

2.4.1 Last Depth to Optimize Control `-l <depth>'
-------------------------------------------------

`-l <depth>': this option sets the last loop depth to be optimized in
control. The higher this depth, the less control overhead.  For
instance, with some input file, a user can generate different
pseudo-codes with different `depth' values as shown below.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -l 1* */
     for (i=0;i<=M;i++) {
       S1 ;
       for (j=0;j<=N;j++) {
         S2 ;
       }
       for (j=0;j<=N;j++) {
         S3 ;
       }
       S4 ;
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -l 2* */
     for (i=0;i<=M;i++) {
       S1 ;
       for (j=0;j<=N;j++) {
         S2 ;
         S3 ;
       }
       S4 ;
     }
     In this example we can see that this option can change the
operation      execution order between statements. Let us remind that
CLooG does not      make any speculation on dependences between
statements      (*note Scattering::). Thus if nothing (i.e. scattering
functions)      forbids this, CLooG considers the above codes to be
equivalent.       If there is no scattering functions, the minimum
value for `depth'      is 1 (in the case of 0, the user doesn't really
need a loop generator !),      and the number of scattering dimensions
otherwise (CLooG will warn the      user if he doesn't respect such
constraint).       The maximum value for depth is -1 (infinity).
Default value is infinity.


File: cloog.info,  Node: First Depth to Optimize Control,  Next: Simplify Convex Hull,  Prev: Last Depth to Optimize Control,  Up: CLooG Options

2.4.2 First Depth to Optimize Control `-f <depth>'
--------------------------------------------------

`-f <depth>': this option sets the first loop depth to be optimized
in control. The lower this depth, the less control overhead (and the
longer      the generated code). For instance, with some input file, a
user      can generate different pseudo-codes with different `depth'
values      as shown below.       The minimum value for `depth' is 1,
and the      maximum value is -1 (infinity).       Default value is 1.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -f 3* */
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
       for (j=1;j<=M;j++) {
         S1 ;
         if (j >= 10) {
           S2 ;
         }
       }
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -f 2* */
     for (i=1;i<=N;i++) {
       for (j=1;j<=9;j++) {
         S1 ;
       }
       for (j=10;j<=M;j++) {
         S1 ;
         S2 ;
       }
     }

2.4.3 Simplify Convex Hull `-sh <boolean>'
------------------------------------------

`-sh <boolean>': this option enables (`boolean=1')      or forbids
(`boolean=0') a simplification step      that may simplify some
constraints.       This option works only for generated code without
 code duplication (it means, you have to tune `-f' and      `-l'
options first to generate only a loop nest with internal      guards).
For instance, with the input file `test/union.cloog', a user      can
generate different pseudo-codes  as shown below.       Default value is
0.
     /* Generated using test/union.cloog and *option -f -1 -l 2 -override* */
     for (i=0;i<=11;i++) {
       for (j=max(0,5*i-50);j<=min(15,5*i+10);j++) {
         if ((i <= 10) && (j <= 10)) {
           S1 ;
         }
         if ((i >= 1) && (j >= 5)) {
           S2 ;
         }
       }
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -sh 1 -f -1 -l 2 -override* */
     for (i=0;i<=11;i++) {
       for (j=0;j<=15;j++) {
         if ((i <= 10) && (j <= 10)) {
           S1 ;
         }
         if ((i >= 1) && (j >= 5)) {
           S2 ;
         }

2.4.4 Once Time Loop Elimination `-otl <boolean>'
-------------------------------------------------

`-otl <boolean>': this option allows (`boolean=1') or      forbids
(`boolean=0') the simplification of loops running      once. Default
value is 1.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -otl 0* */
     for (j=i+1;j<=i+1;j++) {
       S1 ;

2.4.5 Equality Spreading `-esp <boolean>'
-----------------------------------------

`-esp <boolean>': this option allows (`boolean=1') or      forbids
(`boolean=0') values spreading when there      are equalities. Default
value is 0.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -esp 0* */
     i = M+2 ;
     j = N ;
     for (k=i;k<=j+M;k++) {
       S1 ;
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -esp 1* */

2.4.6 Constant Spreading `-csp <boolean>'
-----------------------------------------

`-csp <boolean>': this option allows (`boolean=1') or      forbids
(`boolean=0') values spreading when      there are _constant_
equalities. That is, when the right member      of the equality is a
constant term. Default value is 1.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -csp 0* */
     i = M+2 ;
     j = N ;
     for (k=i;j<=j+M;j++) {
       S1 ;
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -csp 1* */
     i = M+2 ;

       S1(j = N) ;
     }


File: cloog.info,  Node: First Level for Spreading,  Next: C PreProcessor Friendly,  Prev: Constant Spreading,  Up: CLooG Options

2.4.7 First Level for Spreading `-fsp <level>'
----------------------------------------------

`-fsp <level>': it can be useful to set a      first level to begin
equality spreading. Particularly when using      scattering functions,
the user may want to see the scattering dimension      values instead
of spreading or hiding them. If user has set a      spreading, `level'
is      the first level to start it. Default value is 1.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -fsp 1* */
     for (j=0;j<=N+M;j++) {
       S1(i = N) ;
     }
     for (j=0;j<=N+M;j++) {
       S1(i = M) ;
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -fsp 2* */
     c1 = N ;
     for (j=0;j<=c1+M;j++) {
       S1(i = c1) ;
     }
     c1 = M ;
     for (j=0;j<=N+c1;j++) {
       S1(i = c1) ;
     }

2.4.8 C PreProcessor Friendly `-cpp <boolean>'
----------------------------------------------

`-cpp <boolean>': this option ask CLooG for printing a less
human-readable but compilable code by using the C preprocessor
(`boolean=1'). In this case each statement is written as a
function of the iterators corresponding to its domain dimensions:
`Si(value_of_iterator_1,...,value_of_iterator_n)'. It follows      that
the user can easily add preprocessor macros to define each
statement and use the generated textual code directly for compilation.
    When `boolean' is set to 0, the pretty printer has the default
behaviour. Default value is 0.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -cpp 0* */
     for (j=0;j<=N+M;j++) {
       S1(i = N) ;
     }

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -cpp 1* */
     /* and a preprocessor macro set by the user */

     #define S1(i,j) A[(j)]=3*(i)

     for (j=0;j<=N+M;j++) {
       S1(N,j) ;

File: cloog.info,  Node: Statement Block,  Next: Loop Strides,  Prev: C PreProcessor Friendly,  Up: CLooG Options

2.4.9 Statement Block `-block <boolean>'
----------------------------------------

`-block <boolean>': this option allows (`boolean=1') to      create a
statement block for each new iterator, even if there is only      an
equality. This can be useful in order to parse the generated
pseudo-code. When `boolean' is set to 0 or when the generation
language is FORTRAN, this feature is disabled. Default value is 0.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -block 0* */
     i = M+2 ;
     j = N ;
     S1 ;

     /* Generated using the same input file but *option -block 1* */

2.4.10 Loop Strides `-strides <boolean>'
----------------------------------------

`-strides <boolean>': this options allows (`boolean=1') to      handle
non-unit strides for loop increments. This can remove a lot of
guards and make the generated code more efficient. Default value is 0.
     /* Generated using a given input file and *option -strides 0* */
     for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
       if (i%2 == 0) {
         S1(j = i/2) ;
       }
       if (i%4 == 0) {
         S2(j = i/4) ;
       }
     }

     for (i=2;i<=n;i+=2) {
       S1(j = i/2) ;

2.4.11 Compilable Code `-compilable <value>'
--------------------------------------------

`-compilable <value>': this options allows (`value' is not 0)      to
generate a compilable code where all parameters have the integral value
    `value'. This option creates a macro for each statement. Since
CLooG do not know anything about the statement sources, it fills the
  macros with a basic increment that computes the total number of
scanned integral points. The user may change easily the macros according
    to his own needs. This option is possible only if the generated
code is      in C. Default value is 0.

2.5 A Full Example
==================

Let us consider the allocation problem of a Gaussian elimination, i.e.
we want to distribute the various statement instances of the compute
kernel onto different processors. The original code is the following:
     for (i=1;j<=N-1;i++) {
       for (j=i+1;j<=N;j++) {
         c[i][j] = a[j][i]/a[i][i] ;    /* S1 */
         for (k=i+1;k<=N;k++) {
           a[j][k] -= c[i][j]*a[i][k] ; /* S2 */
         }
       }
     }

The best affine allocation functions can be found by any good automatic
parallelizer like LooPo (*note Gri04::):

     T_S1(i,j)^T   = (i)
     T_S2(i,j,k)^T = (k)

To ensure that on each processor, the set of statement instances is
executed according to the original ordering, we add as minor scattering
dimensions the original scheduling (*note Scattering::):

     T_S1(i,j)^T   = (i,0,i,0,j,0)^T
     T_S2(i,j,k)^T = (k,0,i,0,j,1,k,0)^T

To ensure that the scattering functions have the same dimensionality, we
complete the first function with zeroes (this is a CLooG 0.15-UNKNOWN
and previous versions requirement, it should be removed in a future
version, don't worry it's absolutly legal !):

     T_S1(i,j)^T   = (i,0,i,0,j,0,0,0)^T
     T_S2(i,j,k)^T = (k,0,i,0,j,1,k,0)^T

The input file corresponding to this code generation problem could be

`test/manual_gauss.cloog':

   Calling CLooG, with for instance the command line `cloog -fsp 2
gauss.cloog' for a better view of the allocation (the processor number
is given by `p1'), will result on the following target code that
actually implements the transformation. A minor processing on the
dimension `p1' to implement, e.g., MPI calls, which is not shown here
may result in dramatic speedups !

     if (n >= 2) {
       p1 = 1 ;
       for (p5=2;p5<=n;p5++) {
         S1(i = 1,j = p5) ;
       }
     }
     for (p1=2;p1<=n-1;p1++) {

3 Using the CLooG Library
*************************

The CLooG Library was implemented to allow the user to call CLooG
directly from his programs, without file accesses or system calls. The
user only needs to link his programs with C libraries. The CLooG
library mainly provides one function (`cloog_program_generate') which
takes as input the problem description with some options, and returns
the data structure corresponding to the generated code (a
`CloogProgram' structure) which is more or less an abstract syntax tree.
The user can work with this data structure and/or use our pretty
printing function to write the final code in either C or FORTRAN.  Some
other functions are provided for convenience reasons.  These functions
as well as the data structures are described in this section.

3.1.1 CloogMatrix
-----------------

     #define CloogMatrix Matrix

The `CloogMatrix' structure is directly the PolyLib `Matrix' data
structure (*note Wil93::). This structure is devoted to represent a set
of constraints. It is defined in `polylib/types.h' as the following:

     struct matrix
     { unsigned NbRows ;    /* Number of rows. */
       unsigned NbColumns ; /* Number of columns. */
       Value ** p ;         /* Array of pointers to the matrix rows. */
       Value * p_Init ;     /* Matrix rows contiguously in memory. */
       int p_Init_size ;    /* For internal use. */
     }
     typedef struct matrix Matrix;

The whole matrix is stored in memory row after row at the `p_Init'
address. `p' is an array of pointers where `p[i]' points to the first
element of the i^th row.  `NbRows' and `NbColumns' are respectively the
number of rows and columns of the matrix.  Each row corresponds to a
constraint. The first element of each row is an equality/inequality
tag. The constraint is an equality p(x) = 0 if the first element is 0,
but it is an inequality p(x) \geq 0 if the first element is 1.  The
next elements are the unknown coefficients, followed by the parameter
coefficients, then the scalar coefficient.  For instance, the following
three constraints:

         -i + m  = 0
         -j + n >= 0
      i + j - k >= 0

would be represented by the following rows:

     # eq/in  i   j   k   m   n   cst
         0    0  -1   0   1   0    0
         1   -1   0   0   0   1    0
         1    1   1  -1   0   0    0

To be able to provide different precision version (CLooG supports 32
bits, 64 bits and arbitrary precision through the GMP library), the
`Value' type depends on the configuration options (it may be `long int'
for 32 bits version, `long long int' for 64 bits version, and `mpz_t'
for multiple precision version).  The `p_Init_size' field is needed by
the PolyLib to free the memory allocated by `mpz_init' in the multiple
precision release.  Set this field to 0 if you are _not_ using multiple
precision.  Set this field to the size of the `p_Init' array if you
initialized it yourself and if you are using the multiple precision
version.

3.1.2 CloogDomain
-----------------

     struct cloogdomain
     { Polyhedron * polyhedron ;  /* The polyhedral domain. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogdomain CloogDomain ;

The `CloogDomain' structure contains a PolyLib `Polyhedron' data
structure which represents a polyhedral domain (a union of polyhedra)
in both constraint representation and its dual ray representation
(*note Wil93::).  It is defined in `polylib/types.h' as the following:

     struct polyhedron
     { unsigned Dimension,        /* Number of dimensions. */
                NbConstraints,    /* Number of constraints. */
                NbRays,           /* Number of rays. */
                NbEq,             /* Number of vertices (?). */
                NbBid ;           /* Number of extremal rays (?). */
       Value ** Constraint ;      /* Pointers to constraints. */
       Value ** Ray ;             /* Pointers to rays. */
       Value * p_Init ;           /* Constraints and rays contiguously. */
       int p_Init_size ;          /* For internal use. */
       struct polyhedron * next ; /* Next component of the union. */
     }
     typedef struct polyhedron Polyhedron;

The constraint representation is quite the same as in the `Matrix' data
structure (*note CloogMatrix::). The number of rows is `NbConstraints'
and the number of columns in the `Polyhedron' structure is
`Dimension+2' (the +2 comes from the equality/inequality tag and the
scalar coefficient). As in the `Matrix' structure, The data are stored
in memory contiguously at the `p_Init' address and the `p_Init_size'
field is used for memory deallocation in the multiple precision case
(*note CloogMatrix::).  For a better understanding of the dual ray
representation, the user may refer to the PolyLib documentation.

3.1.3 CloogDomainList
---------------------

     struct cloogdomainlist
     { CloogDomain * domain ;
       struct cloogdomainlist * next ;
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogdomainlist CloogDomainList ;

The CloogDomainList structure represents a `NULL' terminated linked list
of domains.

3.1.4 CloogStatement
--------------------

     struct cloogstatement
     { int number ;                  /* The statement unique number. */
       void * usr ;                  /* Pointer for user's convenience. */
       struct cloogstatement * next ;/* Next element of the linked list. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogstatement CloogStatement ;

The `CloogStatement' structure represents a `NULL' terminated linked
list of statements. In CLooG, a statement is only defined by its unique
number (`number'). The user can use the pointer `usr' for his own
convenience to link his own statement representation to the
corresponding `CloogStatement' structure. The whole management of the
`usr' pointer is under the responsibility of the user, in particular,
CLooG never tries to print, to allocate or to free a memory block
pointed by `usr'.


File: cloog.info,  Node: CloogBlock,  Next: CloogBlockList,  Prev: CloogStatement,  Up: CLooG Data Structures

3.1.5 CloogBlock
----------------

     struct cloogblock
     { CloogStatement * statement ; /* Statement list of the block. */
       CloogMatrix * scattering ;   /* Scattering function of the block. */
       int depth ;                  /* Original block depth.*/
       void * usr;                  /* Pointer for user's convenience. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogblock CloogBlock ;

The `CloogBlock' structure represents a statement block.  In a
statement block, every statements have the same iteration domain and
the same scattering function (actually, the scattering functions may
differ only by a scalar coefficient if it just precises the ordering of
the statements within the block). `statement' is the statement list
where the statement order matters, `scattering' is one of the statement
scattering functions and `depth' is the number of dimensions of the
iteration domain (only the unknown, not the tag/parameters/scalar).
`usr' is a pointer for library user's convenience. Note this pointer is
never allocated, freed or printed by CLooG.

3.1.6 CloogBlockList
--------------------

     struct cloogdblocklist
     { CloogBlock * block ;
       struct cloogblocklist * next ;
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogblocklist CloogBlockList ;

The CloogBlockList structure represents a `NULL' terminated linked list
of blocks.

3.1.7 CloogLoop
---------------

     struct cloogloop
     { CloogDomain * domain;       /* Iteration domain. */
       Value stride ;               /* Loop stride. */
       CloogBlock * block ;         /* Included statement block.*/
       void * usr;                  /* Pointer for user's convenience. */
       struct cloogloop * inner ;   /* Loop at the next level. */
       struct cloogloop * next ;    /* Next loop at the same level. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogloop CloogLoop ;

The `CloogLoop' structure represents a loop.  First of all, a loop has
an iteration domain (`domain'). The iterator's stride for loop
increment is `stride'. The loop can include a statement block in the
field `block'. If there is no included statement block, `block' is set
to `NULL'. `usr' is a pointer for library user's convenience. Note that
this pointer is never allocated, freed or printed by CLooG. `inner' is
a pointer to the inner loop, and `next' a pointer to the next loop in
the textual order. If there are no inner loop or no next loop, the
corresponding pointer is set to `NULL'.

3.1.8 CloogNames
----------------

     struct cloognames
     { int nb_scattering ;         /* Scattering dimension number. */
       int nb_iterators ;          /* Iterator number. */
       int nb_parameters ;         /* Parameter number. */
       char ** scattering ;        /* The scattering dimension names. */
       char ** iterators ;         /* The iterator names. */
       char ** parameters ;        /* The parameter names. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloognames CloogNames ;

The `CloogNames' structure represents the scattering dimension, the
iterator and the parameter names in the final program.  `nb_scattering'
(respectively `nb_iterators' and `nb_parameters') is the number of
scattering dimensions number (respectively the iterator and parameter
number) and of elements in the corresponding array of strings
`scattering' (respectively `iterators' and `parameters').  The i^th
scattering dimension name will be associated with the to the dimension
i of the scattering function.  The i^th iterator name will be
associated with the dimension i of the iteration domain.  The i^th
parameter name will be associated with the dimension i of the context
polyhedron.  The user has to ensure that there are enough scattering
dimension, iterator and parameter names.

3.1.9 CloogProgram
------------------

     struct cloogprogram
     { char language ;              /* The language of the program. */
       int  nb_scattdims ;          /* Scattering dimension number. */
       CloogNames  * names ;        /* Iterators and parameters names. */
       CloogDomain * context ;      /* The context of the program. */
       CloogLoop   * loop ;         /* The loops of the program. */
       CloogBlockList * blocklist ; /* The statement block list. */
       void * usr;                  /* For library user's convenience. */
     } ;
     typedef struct cloogprogram CloogProgram ;

The `CloogProgram' structure represents a static control program kernel.
`language' precises the language (`c' for C or `f' for FORTRAN).
`nb_scattdims' gives the number of scattering dimensions.  `context' is
a pointer to the constraints on the program parameters, it can't be the
`NULL' pointer even if there are no constraints on parameters. In such a
case, set a polyhedron with as many dimensions as there are parameters,
with an _always true_ constraint like 1 \geq 0 (this is necessary since
the number of parameters is deduced from the dimension number of the
context constraints). `loop' is a pointer to the first loop of the
program. `names' is a pointer to the various element names (scattering
dimension, iterators, parameters) of the final program. `names' can be
the `NULL' pointer if the user do not want to use our pretty printing
function.  `blocklist' is the linked list of all the statement block
structures.  `usr' is a pointer for library user's convenience. Note
that this pointer is never allocated, freed or printed by CLooG.  As an
example, let us consider the following loop nest:
     for (i=0; i<=n; i++) {
       for (j=0; j<=n; j++) {
         S1 ;
         S2 ;
       }
       for (j=n+1; j<=2*n; j++) {
         S3 ;
       }
     }
The next figure gives a possible representation in memory for this
program thanks to the CLooG data structures (it has been actually
printed by the `cloog_program_print' function). In this figure, `+--
CloogLoop' denotes an `inner' loop, while a `CloogLoop' on the same
column pointed by an arrow denotes a `next' loop:

The `CloogOptions' structure contains all the possible options to rule
CLooG's behaviour (*note Calling CLooG::).  As a reminder, the default
values are:
   * l = -1 (optimize control until the innermost loops),

   * f = 1 (optimize control from the outermost loops),

   * strides = 0 (use only unit strides),

   * sh = 0 (do not simplify convex hulls),

   * esp = 0 (do not spread complex equalities),

   * csp = 1 (spread constant values),

   * fsp = 1 (start to spread from the first iterators),

   * otl = 1 (simplify loops running only once).

   * block = 0 (do not make statement blocks when not necessary).

   * cpp = 0 (do not generate a compilable part of code using
     preprocessor).

   * compilable = 0 (do not generate a compilable code).

3.2.1 cloog_program_generate
----------------------------

     CloogProgram   * cloog_program_generate
     ( CloogProgram * program,       /* Input program. */
       CloogOptions * options        /* Options. */
     ) ;

The `cloog_program_generate' function generates the data structure of
the source code that scans the input polyhedra pointed by `program'
according to the options pointed by `options'.  The process is made
directly on the input structure pointed by `program', thus the original
structure is no longer available after a call to this function. It
returns a pointer to a `CloogProgram' structure containing the solution
in CLooG structures.

   The input `CloogProgram' structure must have only one loop level (no
inner loops): there is one loop per statement block. For a given block,
the corresponding loop carries the iteration domain, the statement
block, and a loop stride initialized to 1. For instance, the input
`CloogProgram' structure that have been sent to
`cloog_program_generate' to achieve the final structure and code shown
as example in the `CloogProgram' structure description (*note
CloogProgram::) was the following one:

     void cloog_program_pprint

       CloogProgram * program,       /* Program to print. */
       CloogOptions * options        /* Options. */
     ) ;

The function `cloog_program_pprint' is a pretty printer for
`CloogProgram' structures when it is a solution provided by the
`cloog_program_generate' function. It prints the code or pseudo-code in
the file pointed by `file' (possibly `stdout') with regards to the
options pointed by `options'.

       CloogDomainList * scattering, /* Additional scattering functions. */
       char ** names ;               /* Additional dimension names. */
     ) ;

The function `cloog_program_scatter' applies scattering functions to
the `CloogProgram' structure pointed by `program'.  Original domains of
`program' are freed. Scattering functions are inside the
`CloogDomainList' structure pointed by `scattering'.  There must be as
many scattering functions in the `CloogDomainList' structure as loops
(i.e. iteration domains) in the `CloogProgram' structure. The first
scattering function of the list will be applied to the iteration domain
of the first loop in the program, and so on.  `names' gives the
scattering dimension names as an array of strings. If `names' is
`NULL', names are automatically generated: the name of the n^th
scattering dimension will be `cn'.

3.2.4 cloog_program_read
------------------------

     CloogProgram * cloog_program_read(FILE *) ;
The `cloog_program_read' function reads the program data from a CLooG
input file (*note Writing The Input File::). It takes as input a
pointer to the file it has to read (possibly `stdin'), and return a
pointer to the read `CloogProgram' structure.

---------------------------------------------

     CloogMatrix * cloog_domain_domain2matrix(CloogDomain *) ;
     CloogDomain * cloog_domain_matrix2domain(CloogMatrix *) ;
Two functions are provided to translate a `CloogDomain' data structure
to a `CloogMatrix' data structure and conversely.  Each function takes
as input a pointer to the data structure to translate and returns as
output a pointer to the translated data structure. The input data
structure if neither modified nor freed. They may be quite useful for
e.g. pretty printing since it is more convenient in constraint (matrix)
representation.

3.2.6 Allocation and Initialization Functions
---------------------------------------------

     CloogStructure * cloog_structure_malloc() ;
Each CLooG data structure has an allocation and initialization function
as shown above, where `Structure' and `structure' have to be replaced
by the name of the convenient structure (without `Cloog' prefix) for
instance `CloogLoop * cloog_loop_malloc() ;'. These functions return
pointers to an allocated structure with fields set to convenient default
values. *Using those functions is mandatory* to support internal
management fields and to avoid upward compatibility problems if new
fields appear. An exception is `cloog_matrix_malloc' since the
`CloogMatrix' comes directly from the PolyLib. It takes two parameters:
the number of rows and columns of the matrix we want to allocate:
     CloogMatrix * cloog_matrix_malloc(unsigned nbrows, unsigned nbcolumns);

3.2.7 Memory Deallocation Functions
-----------------------------------

     void cloog_structure_free(CloogStructure *) ;
Each CLooG data structure has a deallocation function as shown above,
where `Structure' and `structure' have to be replaced by the name of
the convenient structure (without `Cloog' prefix) for instance `void
cloog_loop_free(CloogLoop *) ;'. These functions free the allocated
memory for the structure provided as input. They free memory
recursively, i.e. they also free the allocated memory for the internal
structures.  *Using those functions is mandatory* to avoid memory leaks
on internal management fields and to avoid upward compatibility
problems if new fields appear.

------------------------

     void cloog_structure_print(FILE *, CloogStructure *) ;
Each CLooG data structure has a printing function as shown above,
where `Structure' and `structure' have to be replaced by the name of
the convenient structure (without `Cloog' prefix) for instance `void
cloog_loop_print(FILE *, CloogLoop *) ;'. These functions print the
pointed structure (and its fields recursively) to the file provided as
input (possibly `stdout').

3.3 Example of Library Utilization
==================================

Here is a basic example showing how it is possible to use the CLooG
library, assuming that a standard installation has been done.  The
following C program reads a CLooG input file on the standard input,
then prints the solution on the standard output.  Options are
preselected to the default values of the CLooG software.  This example
is provided in the `example' directory of the CLooG distribution.
     /* example.c */
     # include <stdio.h>
     # include <cloog/cloog.h>

     int main()
     { CloogProgram * program ;
       CloogOptions * options ;

       /* Setting options and reading program informations. */
       options = cloog_options_malloc() ;
       program = cloog_program_read(stdin,options) ;

       /* Generating and printing the code. */
       program = cloog_program_generate(program,options) ;
       cloog_program_pprint(stdout,program,options) ;

       cloog_options_free(options) ;
       cloog_program_free(program) ;
       return 0;
     }

The compilation command could be:
     gcc example.c -lcloog -o example
   A calling command with the input file test.cloog could be:
     more test.cloog | ./example

===========

First of all, it would be very kind to refer the following paper in any
publication that result from the use of the CLooG software or its
library, *note Bas04:: (a bibtex entry is provided behind the title

File: cloog.info,  Node: PolyLib,  Next: GMP Library,  Up: Requirements

4.2.1 PolyLib (mandatory)
-------------------------

To successfully install CLooG, the user need firstly to install PolyLib
version 5.22.1 or above (default 64 bits version is satisfying as well
as 32 bits or GMP multiple precision version).  Polylib can be
downloaded freely at `http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/PolyLib/' or
`http://www.irisa.fr/polylib/'. Once downloaded and unpacked (e.g.
using the `tar -zxvf polylib-5.22.1.tar.gz' command), the user can
compile it by typing the following commands on the PolyLib's root
directory:

   * `./configure'

   * `make'

   * And as root: `make install'

   The PolyLib default installation is `/usr/local'. This directory may
not be inside your library path. To fix the problem, the user should set
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
   if your shell is, e.g., bash or
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
   if your shell is, e.g., tcsh. Add the line to your .bashrc or
.tcshrc (or whatever convenient file) to make this change permanent.
Another solution is to ask PolyLib to install in the standard path by
using the prefix option of the configure script: `./configure
--prefix=/usr'.

   CLooG makes intensive calls to polyhedral operations, and PolyLib
functions do the job. Polylib is a free library written in C for the
manipulation of polyhedra. The library is operating on objects like
vectors, matrices, lattices, polyhedra, Z-polyhedra, unions of
polyhedra and a lot of other intermediary structures. It provides
functions for all the important operations on these structures.

4.2.2 GMP Library (optional)
----------------------------

To be able to deal with insanely large coefficient, the user will need
to install the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP for short) version
4.1.4 or above. It can be freely downloaded from
`http://www.swox.com/gmp'.  The user can compile it by typing the
following commands on the GMP root directory:

   * `./configure'

   * `make'

   * And as root: `make install'

   The GMP default installation is `/usr/local', the same method to fix
a library path problem applies as with PolyLib (*note PolyLib::).

   The PolyLib has to be built using the GMP library by specifying the
option `--with-libgmp=PATH_TO_GMP' to the PolyLib configure script
(where `PATH_TO_GMP' is `/usr/local' if you did not change the GMP
installation directory). Then you have to set the convenient CLooG
configure script options to buid the GMP version (*note Optional
Features::).

4.3 CLooG Basic Installation
============================

Once downloaded and unpacked (e.g. using the `tar -zxvf
cloog-0.15-UNKNOWN.tar.gz' command), you can compile CLooG by typing
the following commands on the CLooG's root directory:

   * `./configure'

   * `make'

   * And as root: `make install'

   Depending on the location of the PolyLib, you may need to set the
option `--with-polylib' of the configure script (e.g. `./configure
--with-polylib=/usr/local' with a default PolyLib installation).

   The program binaries and object files can be removed from the source
code directory by typing `make clean'. To also remove the files that
the `configure' script created (so you can compile the package for a
different kind of computer) type `make distclean'.

   Both the CLooG software and library have been successfully compiled
on the following systems:
   * PC's under Linux, with the `gcc' compiler,

   * PC's under Windows (Cygwin), with the `gcc' compiler,

   * Sparc and UltraSparc Stations, with the `gcc' compiler.

4.4 Optional Features
=====================

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables and user options used during
compilation.  It uses those values to create the `Makefile'. Various
user options are provided by the CLooG's configure script. They are
summarized in the following list and may be printed by typing
`./configure --help' in the CLooG top-level directory.

   * By default, the installation directory is `/usr/local': `make
     install' will install the package's files in `/usr/local/bin',
     `/usr/local/lib' and `/usr/local/include'.  The user can specify
     an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
     `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

   * By default, `configure' will look for the PolyLib in standard
     locations. If necessary, the user can specify the PolyLib path by
     giving `configure' the option `--with-polylib=PATH'.

   * By default, both CLooG software and library are compiled and
     installed.  By giving  `configure' the option `--without-cloog'
     the user disable the compilation and installation of the CLooG
     software.  By giving `configure' the option `--without-lib' the
     user disable the compilation and installation of the CLooG library.

   * By default, CLooG is built in 64bits version if such version of the
     PolyLib is found by `configure'. If the only existing version of
     the PolyLib is the 32bits or if the user give to `configure' the
     option `--with-bits=32', the 32bits version of CLooG will be
     compiled. In the same way, the option `--with-bits=gmp' have to be
     used to build the multiple precision version.

   * By default, `configure' will look for the GMP library (necessary
     to build the multiple precision version) in standard locations. If
     necessary, the user can specify the GMP path by giving `configure'
     the option `--with-gmp=PATH'.

4.5 Uninstallation
==================

The user can easily remove the CLooG software and library from his
system by typing (as root if necessary) from the CLooG top-level
directory `make uninstall'.

5 Documentation
***************

The CLooG distribution provides several documentation sources. First,
the source code itself is as documented as possible. The code comments
use a Doxygen-compatible presentation (something similar to what
JavaDoc does for JAVA). The user may install Doxygen (see
`http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen') to automatically generate a
technical documentation by typing `make doc' or `doxygen
./autoconf/Doxyfile' at the CLooG top-level directory after running the
configure script (*note Installing::). Doxygen will generate
documentation sources (in HTML, LaTeX and man) in the `doc/source'
directory of the CLooG distribution.

   The Texinfo sources of the present document are also provided in the
`doc' directory. You can build it in either DVI format (by typing
`texi2dvi cloog.texi') or PDF format (by typing `texi2pdf cloog.texi')
or HTML format (by typing `makeinfo --html cloog.texi', using
`--no-split' option to generate a single HTML file) or info format (by
typing `makeinfo cloog.texi').
