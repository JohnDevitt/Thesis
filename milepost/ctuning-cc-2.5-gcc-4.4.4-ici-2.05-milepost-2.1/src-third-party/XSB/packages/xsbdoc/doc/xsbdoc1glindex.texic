@unnumbered Global Index

This is a global index containing pointers to places where concepts, 
 predicates, modes, properties, types, applications, etc., are referred to
 in the text of the document. Note that due to limitations of the
 @code{info} format unfortunately only the first reference will appear in
 online versions of the document.
